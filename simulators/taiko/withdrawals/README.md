# Withdrawals Interop Hive Simulator

The simulator contains the implementation of the tests described in this
document.


## General Considerations for all tests
- A single validating node comprises an execution client, beacon client and validator client (unless specified otherwise)
- All validating nodes have the same number of validators (unless specified otherwise)
- An importer node is a node that has no validators but might be connected to the network
- Execution client Shanghai timestamp transition is automatically calculated from the Capella Epoch timestamp


## Test Cases

### Capella/Shanghai Transition

* [x] Capella/Shanghai Transition
